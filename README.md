## Welcome to the Jayich Lab's GitHub Organization

We're a research group at UC Santa Barbara that does basic science primarily with trapped atomic and molecular ions.  You can read more about that on our [website.](https://jayich.io/)

We do what we can to make work that we think might be helpful to others publicly available on GitHub (this takes extra effort to make sure things are reasonably polished for public consumption).  If one of our repos is useful, consider giving it a star. 
This gives us valualbe feedback that the work is indeed helpful, and we'll likely put more time into the project.

## Welcome to the Jayich Lab's GitHub Organization

We're a research group at UC Santa Barbara that does basic science primarily with trapped atomic and molecular ions.  You can read more about our research on our [website.](https://jayich.io/)

We do what we can to make repos public that might be helpful - this takes extra effort to polish for public consumption.  If a repo is useful, please star it. 
This gives us valuable feedback (and we'll likely put more time into the project).

We use [Zulip](https://zulip.com/) for asynchronous communication, it's great.

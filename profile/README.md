## Welcome to the Jayich Lab's GitHub Organization

We're a research group at UC Santa Barbara that does basic science primarily with trapped atomic and molecular ions.  You can read more about our research on our [website.](https://jayich.io/)

We do what we can to make repos that might be helpful to others public (this takes extra effort to make sure things are reasonably polished for public consumption).  If one of our repos is useful, consider giving it a star. 
This gives us valuable feedback that the work is helpful (and we'll likely put more time into the project).

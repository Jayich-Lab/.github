## Welcome to the Jayich Lab's GitHub Organization

We're a research group at UC Santa Barbara that does basic science primarily with trapped atomic and molecular ions.  You can read more about our research on our [website.](https://jayich.io/)

We do what we can to make repos public that might be helpful to others (this takes extra effort to polish for public consumption).  If a repo is useful, consider giving it a star. 
This gives us valuable feedback that the work is helpful (and we'll likely put more time into the project).
